# Advent of Code 2018

[_Advent of Code_](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. It is developed by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)

These are my answers for the 2018 year, it is also my first time attepmting something like this.

_Note to reader:_ I am going to attempt this in multiple languages. Some I will be comfortable with, some will be brand new
